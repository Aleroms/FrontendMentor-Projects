## My process
I first started with the structure, making sure that everything was on top of each other and then utilized `display flex` to get elements on the same line. Afterwards, I worked with spacing and added margin/padding to get a visual similarity. Lastly, I focused on the active states. I found the overlay on the image hard to do so I started on the hover effect on text elements. After researching online, I found a resource that could help me on that issue.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the `css position:absolute` removes the element from the html flow and that `css position:relative ` stay in the same place if it isn't altered.
### Continued development

 I still have much to learn about `css position: absolute` and `css position: relative`.
### Useful resources

- [Overlay hover effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8&t=1598s) - This helped me know how to approach the hover effect on the overlay.
