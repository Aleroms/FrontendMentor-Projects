## My process

This challenge I wanted to try gaining experience using jQuery. I got stuck along the way because it was my first attempt but I did have a few resources to use, such as jQuery documentation of `toggle() , show() , hide()` methods.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to look up what resources i need off of google when I did not know how to approach the topic
### Continued development
Since this is my first exp with jQuery, id like to learn more about the shorthand notation of dom manipulation

### Useful resources

- [jQuery Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/show/#show) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
