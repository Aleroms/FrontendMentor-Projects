## My process

I started out creating the html and css. Just the barebones to pass without implementing the API. Then I did research on how to request data and found the Axios library to be the most helpful and straightforward for beginners. Afterwards, I finished off doing a mobile view.

### Built with

- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
 - how to make GET requests 
 - how to read API documentation
 - how to emit events with Vue
### Continued development
After doing this project I kind of want to try another project. I heard of this KanyeAPI and his quotes and I really wanna try to use that haha

### Useful resources

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - This is a promise-based HTTP client which makes it suitable for fetching data during server-side display.
