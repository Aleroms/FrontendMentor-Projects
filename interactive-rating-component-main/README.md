## My process

I first started out building the container. Getting it to look like the design. Then I continued onto the thank you container. Now that the containers look like how they were designed to, I got started on the javascript functionality. This was my first project that I worked with javascript to target the DOM structure. I had to look up things like how to edit p-tags or how to use the onClick method, or even how to get the active element
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to hide divs using `css .div{visibility: hidden}` which I hadn't previous known. 
I learned how to use mixin and scss preprocessor. 
I learned how to target elements using `document.getElementByID`
I learned how to use javascript in web developmentis section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

In future projects, id wanna know more about how javascript is applied into web development
### Useful resources

- [Stack-Overflow css visibility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5113246/make-div-invisible-in-css-and-javascript) - This helped me know how to approach hiding the main container and activating the thank you container
- [Sass resource](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This was resource I used for Sass. I hadn't used sass before so this was valuable.
- [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) - This is the resource I used to understand how to modify html and register events like on clicking
