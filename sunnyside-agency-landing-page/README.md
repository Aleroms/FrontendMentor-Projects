## My process

### What I learned

My approach to this project was to understand and have more experience using the composition API instead of the options API. I prefer the options API rather than the composition because of its easy to understand user-interface.

I learned that having a single css file to store every css is not scalable. For future projects, I will start using the Vue 'style' tag. I have come to appreciate how vue has its `style`, `script` and `template` tag. As for frameworks like react, I like its approach in creating a folder system where the `.jsx` and `.css` files live in the same folder but personally, I think Vue improves on this file by creating a vue file where it could be found. Instead of two files.

- [Dynamic Image Pathing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66419471/vue-3-vite-dynamic-image-src) - This helped me when I was stuck on image pathing. `@/assets/images...` did not work and the solution was to replace `@/` with `/src/`.
- [Background Images on divs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-bind-the-background-image-in-vue-js#:~:text=js%20using%20the%20style%20tag,image%20in%20it%20with%20url.) - This is an amazing article which helped me figure out how to bind an image to as a background of a div
