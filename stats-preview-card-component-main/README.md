## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
I started with a mobile first approach and then started developing for desktop, although that was really hard tbh. I was having trouble with having both sizes equal to each other so i switched to a `display grid` instead.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned
Developing for all screens is hard!
