## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://capable-malasada-b688ec.netlify.app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
Mobile-first design approach is a useful way to work with, but it is not the only way to approach. For this, I started with a desktop-first approach and found it just the same as mobile-first.
### Continued development
between 1000px to 800px it looks like the middle card is being squished. This forces the middle paragraph text to become longer. I would like to understand why that is happening in the future
