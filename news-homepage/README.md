## My process

I started out with a mobile approach but it messed up my pc view and that sucked.

### Built with

- Vue :)

### What I learned
this was a hard project because around the middle i got a job and stopped wanting to edit this, finding more time to play video games with the homies  rather than further my skillset because that's always easier. At the end there was this error and it did not want to fix itself. TBH I don't even know what I did it just stopped reading the scss file so my css wasn't being vued (lol) and so i gave up cause honestly there are more projects to complete and I rather do that.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
