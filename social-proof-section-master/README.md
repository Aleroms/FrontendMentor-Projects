## My process
This project has been grander than all the previous [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/aleroms) projects. I started it off with sketching a layout considering the box model. Additionally, I set the `background-color` of the parent element so it could be easier to identify each section and I tried to choose padding over margin where I thought it made more sense.
I started with a mobile-first approach while taking into consideration the desktop view as well; creating `html <div>`s, `html <article>`s or `html <section>`s where I thought most appropriate. In the end, this project did take longer than others because of my planning and execution.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
larger projects take more planning, imo. Some sections would be better if done through React, such as my Card and Review sections. The code would be cleaner.
